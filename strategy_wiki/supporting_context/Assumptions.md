# Strategic Assumptions

*The foundational truths we believe about the future market, technology, and competition. If these are wrong, our strategy risks failure.*

## Technology Landscape
1.  **The Oligopoly of Intelligence**: We assume that large, general-purpose models (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) will dominate. We do *not* believe in a fragmented future of thousands of niche, vertical AIs.
    *   *Implication*: We should not invest in building our own LLMs (Foundation Models). We should invest in the "Application Layer" and "Context Layer" on top of the giants.
2.  **The 5-Year Horizon**: In 2030, people will still be conversing with these major models. The interface might evolve, but the "Big Model" paradigm holds.

## Market Dynamics
1.  **The "Super-Intelligent" Client**: We assume clients will have access to the same powerful AI tools we do. "Access to information" is no longer a differentiator.
2.  **The B2B Barrier**: We assume that despite AI, the mechanics of B2B sales (trust, networks, complex stakeholder management) will remain human-centric.

## The Consultant's Role
1.  **AI is Passive**: We assume AI will remain a tool that requires *intent*. It can answer any "How", but it cannot decide the "Why" or "What Next" without human direction.
