# 5. Management Systems

**The Culture**: The systems, structures, and measures that support our choices.

## The Current State
Flat hierarchy. "Own the energy." Decentralized autonomy.

## The Beautiful Questions

### 1. Governing the Irregular
> *How do we manage risk without stifling experimentation?*

**The Reality**: Liability is currently not a major issue for us (EU/Denmark context).
*   **The Challenge**: The real risk is not being sued, but losing our "Common Sense". How do we maintain our speed and "ask for forgiveness" culture while ensuring we don't accidentally leak client secrets?

### 2. The Incentive Model
> *Do we reward "Hours Billed" or "Value Created"?*

If AI allows us to do 100 hours of work in 1 hour, the "Billable Hour" model is dead. What is the new management system for measuring and rewarding performance?

### 3. The Feedback Loop
> *How does the "Edge" teach the "Center"?*

Innovation happens at the edge (on client sites). We need a system that rapidly captures these edge-cases (new prompts, new use-cases) and distributes them to the whole firm instantly.

## Emerging Hypotheses
*   **Hypothesis A**: **"Value-Based Pricing"**. We shift our entire management system away from time-tracking to outcome-tracking.
*   **Hypothesis B**: **"The AI Council"**. A rotating body of diverse consultants (not just partners) who set the ethical and operational guidelines for AI usage, keeping it "human-led."
