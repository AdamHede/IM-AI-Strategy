# AI Strategy: The Living Wiki

Welcome to the strategic brain of Implement Consulting Group's AI initiative. This repository is designed to be a living document, evolving as we answer the "Beautiful Questions" that define our future.

## The Current Strategic Dilemmas
*The questions we are actively wrestling with.*

### 1. The Senior Inertia
> *How do we bridge the gap between "AI-native" juniors and "AI-reluctant" seniors?*
*   **The Dilemma**: Our seniors have the wisdom but resist the tool. Our juniors have the tool but lack the wisdom. How do we fuse them before they drift apart?

### 2. The "Builder" Dilemma
> *How do we channel the "builder" minority without becoming a software company?*
*   **The Dilemma**: We have people who *want* to build world-class tools. If we don't let them, they might leave. If we do let them, we might waste millions building things we should have bought.

### 3. The Pricing Paradox
> *How do we price "AI-augmented" work?*
*   **The Dilemma**: If we deliver a 6-month project in 6 weeks, do we charge 1/4 of the price? Or do we charge for the *value*? If the latter, how do we convince procurement?

### 4. The M&A Accelerator
> *Do we buy small AI boutiques or traditional firms to upgrade?*
*   **The Dilemma**: Buying AI boutiques gives us talent but culture clashes. Buying traditional firms gives us market share but "legacy debt." Which is the faster route to dominance?

### 5. The "Soul" of the Firm
> *As we automate, what is the *one* thing we will *never* automate?*
*   **The Dilemma**: Efficiency is addictive. We need a "Red Line" that defines our humanity. Is it the final client presentation? The difficult feedback session? The hiring interview?


## The Strategy Cascade (Playing To Win)

We are building our strategy on the five integrated choices of the Playing To Win framework. Click on a module to explore the deep questions and emerging hypotheses.

1.  **[Winning Aspiration](./01_Winning_Aspiration.md)**
    *   *The existential purpose. Why do we exist in an AI world?*
2.  **[Where to Play](./02_Where_To_Play.md)**
    *   *The battlefield. Where is the "Human Premium" highest?*
3.  **[How to Win](./03_How_To_Win.md)**
    *   *The differentiator. How do we scale "Heart" with "Code"?*
4.  **[Capabilities](./04_Capabilities.md)**
    *   *The engine. What must we build to back up our promise?*
5.  [Management Systems](./05_Management_Systems.md)
6.  **[Strategic Questions & Triggers](./06_Strategic_Questions_and_Triggers.md)**
    *   *The culture. How do we govern "The Irregular"?*
