# 2. Where to Play

**The Battlefield**: Choosing the spaces where our unique mix of "Nerd" and "Human" generates the highest value.

## The Current State
We play in all industries (Generalist). We play from the Nordics out. We handle "Change with Impact."
**Ambition**: To be the **Preferred Global Transformation Partner**.

## The Beautiful Questions

### 1. The "Human Premium" Geography
> *Where is the "Human Premium" highest?*

AI drives the cost of cognitive tasks to zero. We must play where the value of *trust*, *empathy*, and *political navigation* is highest. Is that in the Boardroom? In M&A? In Public Sector transformation? Or is it in the messy middle of operations?

### 2. The Vertical vs. Horizontal Dilemma
> *Do we build "The AI for Energy" (Vertical) or "The Methodology for Change" (Horizontal)?*

If we play everywhere, we risk being beaten by niche AI agents trained on specific vertical data. Do we double down on our *process* expertise (Change Management) as our primary playing field?

### 3. The Client Archetype
> *Who is the client that *needs* us most?*

**The Reality**: We work for everyone. From "Legacy Giants" (like Novo Nordisk) to small businesses.
*   **The Sweet Spot**: Organizations with **1,000 - 20,000 employees**.
    *   *Why?* They are large enough to have complex, "irregular" problems that require transformation (not just change management), but small enough that we can still reach the decision-makers and drive actual impact.
*   **The Human-AI Hybrid Value**:
    *   We focus on problems where **Trust**, **Empathy**, and **Complex Decision Making** are paramount.
    *   *Sectors*: Healthcare (clinical judgment + data), Finance (compliance + intuition), and High-Stakes Transformations (where failure is not an option).
    *   *The "Messy Middle"*: We thrive in operational chaos where AI alone fails because it lacks context. We bring the "Human Bridge."
*   **The Ambition**: We want to crack the "Mega-Giants" (Fortune 50), but we must do it without losing the agility that allows us to serve the smaller players.

## Emerging Hypotheses
*   **Hypothesis A**: We play in **"High-Stakes Transformations"**. We exit commodity work (PMO, basic analysis) and focus 100% on "Bet the Company" moments where AI is a tool, not the driver.
*   **Hypothesis B**: We play in **"The Gap"**. The space between the *strategic advice* (McKinsey) and the *technical implementation* (Accenture). We own the *adoption*.
