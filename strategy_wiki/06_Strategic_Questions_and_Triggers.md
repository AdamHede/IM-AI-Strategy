# 6. Strategic Questions & Trigger Points

**The Watchtower**: A living list of the "Big Questions" we haven't answered yet, and the "Trigger Points" that will force us to act.

## Trigger Points
> *If the world changes X, we do Y.*

*   **Trigger 1**: If **AI commoditizes "Strategy Formulation"** (i.e., GPT-6 writes better strategies than partners)...
    *   **Then**: We shift 100% of our business model to **"Execution & Change"**. We stop selling "slides" and sell "outcomes."
*   **Trigger 2**: If **Clients successfully build internal "AI Studios"**...
    *   **Then**: We pivot from "Building AI for them" to **"Governing their AI"**. We become the "Quality Assurance" and "Ethics" auditors for their internal teams.
*   **Trigger 3**: If **A major competitor (McKinsey/Accenture) releases a fully automated "Consultant-in-a-Box"**...
    *   **Then**: We double down on **"High-Touch"** and **"Political Complexity"**. We market ourselves as the *premium* human alternative to their robot.

## The Deep Dive: Questions Behind the Question
*These are the fundamental tensions that underpin our strategic choices. We must solve these to unlock the answers.*

1.  **M&A: The Culture vs. Speed Paradox**
    *   > *If we buy to speed up (Acqui-hire), do we dilute the 'Implement Soul' that is our main differentiator?*
2.  **Product: The Service vs. Product Tension**
    *   > *Can a consultancy sell 'products' without becoming a vendor? Does the 'product' serve the 'advice', or does the advice sell the product?*
3.  **Internal Apps: The Builder's Trap**
    *   > *Does building our own OS make us 'sovereign' or just 'distracted'? Are we building for *client value* or *consultant ego*?*
4.  **Hiring: The Generalist's Fate**
    *   > *In a world of specialized AI agents, is the 'Smart Generalist' a dying breed or the *only* breed that matters?*
5.  **Commercial: The Value Abyss**
    *   > *If we stop charging for time, we must charge for value. But are we brave enough to share the *risk* of that value not materializing?*
