# 4. Capabilities

**The Engine**: The specific activities and assets we must build to deliver on our "How to Win" choices.

## The Current State
Strong generalist consultants. Growing data science team. "IM GPT" pilot.

## The Beautiful Questions

### 1. The Skillset Shift
> *What is the "Latin" of the 21st Century?*

If coding is the new literacy, what is the *next* literacy?
*   **The Junior Problem**: The "Talent War" is manageable, but we face a new challenge: **"Senior Inertia"**. Our seniors are reluctant to use AI effectively, while our juniors are native.
*   **The Goal**: We need to define the *mandatory curriculum* not just for new hires, but for *partners*.

### 2. The "Orchestrator" Capability
> *If we don't build the models, what do we build?*

**The Assumption**: We do not believe in a future of niche AIs; we believe in the dominance of global giants (ChatGPT, Gemini).
*   **The "Builder" Minority**: A significant minority of our people *want* to build world-class tools. We must channel this energy without becoming a software shop.
*   **The Majority View**: The majority prefers standard, off-the-shelf tools.
*   **The Capability**: We do not need to build "Implement LLM" from scratch. We need to build the **"Context Layer"**. Our capability is not *training* models, but *orchestrating* them.

### 3. The "Inner Nerd" Infrastructure
> *How do we democratize the power of AI to the non-technical consultant?*

We need a capability that allows a sociologist consultant to build an AI agent without writing code. The "No-Code / Low-Code" capability is not just a tool; it's a strategic necessity for our culture.

## Emerging Hypotheses
*   **Hypothesis A**: **The "Implement Academy"**. We build a world-class internal university that turns every consultant into an "AI Architect" within 6 months.
*   **Hypothesis B**: **The "Knowledge Graph"**. We invest heavily in structuring our past project data to create a proprietary "Implement Brain" that every consultant can query.
